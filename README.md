# Spike-time-prediction-from-LFP-signals
In our project, we employed a Transformer network to predict the timing of spikes based on local field potential (LFP) signals. The Transformer network, originally developed for natural language processing tasks, has proven to be highly effective in various sequential data analysis tasks, including time-series prediction.

For this specific application, we harnessed the power of the Transformer's attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies and patterns within the LFP signals. By processing the LFP data using a Transformer architecture, we were able to learn and represent intricate relationships in the signal data, ultimately enabling accurate predictions of when neuronal spikes would occur.

This approach allowed us to enhance our understanding of the relationships between LFP signals and spike events, making it a valuable tool for neuroscientific research and potentially contributing to advancements in the field of neural spike prediction and analysis.
